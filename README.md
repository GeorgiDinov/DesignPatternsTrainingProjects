# DesignPatternsTrainingProjects
Took a course on design patterns, made projects for revisitting and additional study
All of design pattern implementations have brief overview either commented in the main method, or in a separate text file.
Mind that these explanations are not full, but rather a small reminder for the whole picture and participants. 
Further study on the topic is required.
